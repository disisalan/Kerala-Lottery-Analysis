Number Trends
THis is the analysis of all the trends and patterns
Explore our lottery dataset using three key columns:

    series: The lottery series identifier (e.g., "AB")
    sn: The complete winning entry (e.g., "AB 123456")
    numbers: The 7-digit number part (e.g., "123456")

there are multiple analysis done wrt to various columns

### **1. Number Frequency and Patterns**  
- **Most common numbers**: Identify the most frequently drawn 7-digit numbers. 


- **Most common series**: Analyze which series (e.g., AA, AB, etc.) appear the most in big wins.  
- **Least common and never drawn numbers**: Find numbers that have been drawn the least or never in your dataset.  
- **Repeating digit analysis**: Are numbers with repeating digits (e.g., 1111111, 2223222) really less common?   
- **Digit position analysis**: Check the frequency of individual digits at each position in the 7-digit number (e.g., first digit most commonly 1, 2, etc.).  
- **Number clustering**: Check if winning numbers are grouped within a certain range (e.g., 1000000-2000000 vs. 8000000-9000000).
